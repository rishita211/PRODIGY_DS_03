Predict customer subscription to a term deposit using a Decision Tree Classifier trained on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset, with automatic data fetching and visualization.
# ðŸŒ³ Bank Marketing Prediction with Decision Tree Classifier

This project builds a machine learning model using a Decision Tree to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and marketing interaction data.

âœ… The dataset is automatically fetched from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) using the `ucimlrepo` package.

## ðŸ§  Features Used

The dataset includes customer information like:

- Age, Job, Marital Status, Education
- Contact Method, Day, Duration
